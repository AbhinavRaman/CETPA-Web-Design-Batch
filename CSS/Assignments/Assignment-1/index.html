            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</li>
            <li><span id="linethrough">CSS is not necessary</span> <span class="li3">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at ones.</li>
            <li id="li4">External style sheet are stored in CSS files.</li>

    <h1 id="secondheading">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - By using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - By using style in head section.</li>
        <li>External - By using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in ecternal CSS files. However, <span id="info">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
    
    <p id="smallLine">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

    <p id="mediumLine">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
